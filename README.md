# rblx-fps-unlocker
A FPS unlocker for Roblox that doesn't change any system files.

## Safety and anticheat
Since this script does not modify any of Roblox's files, Byfron does not trigger and thus it is entirely safe.

## Download
### GitHub (Recommended)
You can download a release from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/just-autumn/rblx-fps-unlocker/releases)

### Building from source
This is a Python project so compilation *isn't required* but can be done. The tool I use it [PyInstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/) with the following command:
```bat
pyinstaller --clean -F unlocker.py -n "Roblox FPS Unlocker" -i "icon.png"
```
